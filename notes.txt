1. tinker issue: the one to many relationship working fine but standing at child model to fetch the paren, tinker return null. => testing in controller it work fine.
2. whenever updating migration file(s) => run php artisan migrate:reset => delete all rows in migrations table => run php artisan migrate => migrate all 

3. when creating foreing key, should manually migrate to make sure parent table got executed before the child table.

4. must follow naming convention when building laravel restful resource. refer to the link and examples below:
link: https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/controllers

examples:
Verb	    Path	          Action     Route Name
GET	    /photo	          index	     photo.index
GET	    /photo/create         create     photo.create
POST	    /photo	          store	     photo.store
GET	    /photo/{photo}        show	     photo.show
GET	    /photo/{photo}/edit	  edit	     photo.edit
PUT/PATCH   /photo/{photo}	  update     photo.update
DELETE	    /photo/{photo}	  destroy    photo.destroy

5. in order to add new field to existing table, we need to add doctrine/dbal to dependencies in composer.json. save the file and run command "composer update" using GitBash is much better than using cmd. Then create new migration just for new field.
